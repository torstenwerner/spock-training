This page explains incompatible changes between successive versions and provides suggestions on how to deal with them.

== 1.0

Specs, Spec base classes and third-party extensions may have be recompiled in order to work with Spock 1.0.

JRE 1.5 and Groovy versions below 2.0 are no longer supported.

Make sure to pick the right binaries for your Groovy version of choice: `groovy-2.0` for Groovy 2.0/2.1/2.2,
`groovy-2.3` for Groovy 2.3, and `groovy-2.4` for Groovy 2.4 and higher. Spock won't let you run with a "wrong" version.

_See official documentation for more information._
