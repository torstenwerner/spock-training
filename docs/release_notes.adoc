= Release Notes

== 1.0 (released 2015-03-02)

1.0 has arrived! Finally (and some years late) the version number communicates what
https://code.google.com/p/spock/wiki/WhoIsUsingSpock[Spock users] have known for ages - that Spock isn't only useful
and fun, but also reliable, mature, and here to stay. So please, go out and tell everyone who hasn't been assimilated
that now is the time to join the party!

A special thanks goes to all our tireless speakers and supporters, only a few of which are listed here: Andres Almiray,
CÃ©dric Champeau, David Dawson, Rob Fletcher, Sean Gilligan, Ken Kousen, Guillaume Laforge,
http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main[NFJS Tour], Graeme Rocher, Baruch Sadogursky, Odin Hole Standal,
Howard M. Lewis Ship, Ken Sipe, Venkat Subramaniam, Russel Winder.
